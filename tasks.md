# WebSocket Structural Mutations - Convergence Investigation

## Goal

Make the ConnectorTester pass with structural mutations enabled for WebSocket sync.
Run command: `dotnet run --project src/Namotion.Interceptor.ConnectorTester --launch-profile websocket -c Release`
60s mutation phase + 60s convergence timeout.

## Test Setup

- **Server**: 1000 value mutations/sec, 2 structural mutations/sec
- **Client-A**: 100 value mutations/sec, 1 structural mutation/sec
- **Client-B**: 100 value mutations/sec, 1 structural mutation/sec
- **Chaos profiles**: no-chaos (current), server-only, client-a-only, all-clients, full-chaos
- **Structural mutations**: ObjectRef replacements, Collection adds/removes, Dictionary adds/removes
- **Total per run**: ~240 structural mutations, ~63,000 value mutations

## Architecture Overview

```
MutationEngine (per participant)
    ↓ property writes
ChangeTracker (IWriteInterceptor)
    ↓ SubjectPropertyChange events
ChangeQueueProcessor (8ms buffer, dedup by PropertyReference)
    ↓ flush batch
SubjectUpdateFactory.CreatePartialUpdateFromChanges()
    ↓ SubjectUpdate (flat dict of subjectId → properties)
WebSocketSubjectHandler.BroadcastChangesAsync()
    ↓ serialize + send to all clients
WebSocketSubjectClientSource.ReceiveLoopAsync()
    ↓ deserialize
SubjectUpdateApplier.ApplyUpdate()
    ↓ set property values via RegisteredSubjectProperty.SetValue()
ChangeTracker fires again → echoed back (filtered by source)
```

### Key Mechanisms

- **useCompleteStructuralState=true**: Server broadcasts read current live property values instead of change snapshots (avoids stale diffs with multiple concurrent writers)
- **Echo prevention**: ChangeQueueProcessor has source filter. Server source=handler, Client source=clientSource. MutationEngine source=null (passes both filters).
- **Dedup**: ChangeQueueProcessor keeps first old value + last new value per PropertyReference via `WithOldValueFrom`
- **SubjectUpdateApplyContext.TryMarkAsProcessed**: Prevents double-processing of subjects during apply

## Fixes Applied (This Branch)

### Prior Sessions (Fixes 1-7)

1. **Idempotent collection insert** - Guard against duplicate Insert operations
2. **Count trim guards** - Prevent out-of-range Remove operations
3. **Dedup old-value merging** - ChangeQueueProcessor keeps first old + last new
4. **Partial update path ordering** - Process structural changes before value changes
5. **ApplyObjectUpdate registry lookup** - Reuse existing subjects by stable ID
6. **Complete structural state** - Server broadcasts use `useCompleteStructuralState: true`
7. **Stable base62 subject IDs** - 22-char base62-encoded GUIDs for cross-participant identity

### This Session (Fixes 8-9)

8. **Race condition mitigation for detached subjects** (SubjectUpdateFactory.cs)
   - **8a**: When `useCompleteStructuralState=true`, read `property.GetValue()` (current live) instead of `change.GetNewValue()` (snapshot) for Collection, Dictionary, AND ObjectRef
   - **8b**: In `ProcessSubjectComplete`, create empty Subjects entry when subject is detached (`TryGetRegisteredSubject()` returns null)

9. **CRITICAL: SubjectUpdateApplier if/else bug** (SubjectUpdateApplier.cs)
   - **Problem**: `ApplyUpdate()` had an if/else structure. When root subject had entries in `Subjects` dict (because root properties changed in the same batch), the `else` branch (which iterates ALL subjects by stable ID) was SKIPPED. Non-root subject changes were **silently dropped**.
   - **Fix**: Changed if/else to always run the stable-ID-lookup loop after the root path. `TryMarkAsProcessed` prevents double-processing.
   - **Impact**: 97% reduction in failures (from ~30 structural failures to exactly 1)

10. **CRITICAL: ApplyObjectUpdate replacement bug** (SubjectUpdateApplier.cs)
    - **Problem**: When `existingItem is not null`, the code assumed it was the SAME logical subject as the update target. It blindly set `existingItem.SetSubjectId(propertyUpdate.Id)` and kept `targetItem = existingItem`. Since `existingItem == targetItem`, `property.SetValue()` was NEVER called. For ObjectRef REPLACEMENTS (server swapped subject A → B), this meant the client kept pointing to A (with corrupted stable ID set to B's ID), instead of replacing it with B.
    - **Fix**: Check if existing item's stable ID matches `propertyUpdate.Id`. If they match → same subject, keep it. If they differ → replacement, look up or create the correct target subject by stable ID.
    - **Why it only affected ~0.4%**: In most cases, the properties were fully overwritten in-place (making OLD functionally equivalent to NEW). Failure occurred when `TryMarkAsProcessed` returned false or concurrent modifications prevented full property overwrite.

## Current State

### Test Results After All Fixes (Including Fix 10)

**All cycles PASS with all chaos profiles:**

| Cycle | Profile | Result | Convergence |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1     | no-chaos | PASS | 0.0s |
| 2     | server-only | PASS | 0.0s |
| 3     | client-a-only | PASS | 0.0s |
| 4     | all-clients | PASS | 0.0s |
| 5     | full-chaos | PASS | 0.0s |
| 6-11  | all profiles again | PASS | 0.0s |

- **0** failures across 11+ cycles
- ~63,000 value mutations + ~240 structural mutations per cycle
- All chaos events (Kill, Disconnect) recovered correctly
- Convergence is immediate (0.0s) after mutation phase ends

## Open Investigation

### Hypotheses for Remaining 1 ObjectRef Failure

1. **Timing race in flush**: The ObjectRef replacement change is captured but the flush batch builds the update at a moment when a concurrent MutationEngine write on the SAME property overwrites it before `property.GetValue()` reads it (since `useCompleteStructuralState=true` reads current live value, a concurrent write could replace the value AGAIN, and the intermediate value is lost)

2. **Client-side apply ordering**: When a client receives an update that replaces an ObjectRef, the new target subject might not yet be registered in the client's SubjectRegistry. `ApplyObjectUpdate` tries registry lookup by stable ID, fails, then tries to create from factory — but if the subject data is in the same update, it might not be processed yet.

3. **ChangeQueueProcessor dedup**: If an ObjectRef property is written twice in the same buffer window (e.g., MutationEngine replaces it, then a WebSocket update from the other client also touches it), the dedup keeps first-old + last-new. The intermediate value (which was the correct server state) is lost.

4. **Broadcast excluded by source filter**: A client sends an ObjectRef update to server. Server applies it (source=connection). ChangeQueueProcessor captures the change but source filter might exclude it from broadcast back to OTHER clients.

### Next Steps

- [ ] Analyze latest failure snapshots in detail (exact subject IDs, parent properties)
- [ ] Add targeted diagnostic logging to ObjectRef broadcast/apply path
- [ ] Determine: is the update never sent, sent but not received, or received but not applied?
- [ ] Check if the failing ObjectRef is always a server-originated or client-originated mutation
- [ ] Consider whether hypothesis 1 or 4 explains the "random which client fails" pattern

## Future Consideration: Eliminate `useCompleteStructuralState`

### Background

`useCompleteStructuralState=true` was introduced as Fix 6 to work around unreliable diff-based updates when multiple concurrent writers (server MutationEngine + incoming client updates) modify the same structural properties. When enabled, the server reads the **current live property value** at flush time instead of computing a diff from old→new change snapshots.

### Problems with `useCompleteStructuralState`

- **Bandwidth**: Sends the full collection/dictionary/object state on every change instead of a minimal diff (Insert/Remove operations). For large collections this is wasteful.
- **Race window**: Reading live state at flush time introduces its own race — a concurrent write between change capture and `property.GetValue()` can cause the intermediate state to be lost (hypothesis 1 for the remaining ObjectRef bug).
- **Conceptual mismatch**: The diff-based protocol (Insert/Remove/Move operations) was designed for efficiency. Bypassing it with complete state is a workaround, not a fix.

### Can We Fix the Protocol to Not Need It?

The root cause that motivated `useCompleteStructuralState` is: **the change snapshot (old/new values) can become stale between capture and flush when concurrent writers modify the same property**.

Potential alternatives:
1. **Lock structural writes during flush**: Ensure MutationEngine and incoming client updates cannot write structural properties while ChangeQueueProcessor is building the SubjectUpdate. Downside: increases contention, may hurt throughput.
2. **Sequence-aware dedup**: Instead of keeping first-old + last-new, keep ALL structural changes in order and replay them as a sequence of operations. This preserves intermediate states.
3. **Snapshot-on-capture for structural properties**: Take a deep snapshot of collection/dictionary state at change-capture time (not just the reference). This makes the change self-contained. Downside: allocation cost per structural change.
4. **Server-side version vectors**: Track per-property version numbers. If a flush detects the property was mutated again since the captured change, re-read and send complete state only for that property (adaptive approach).

### Verdict

Investigate whether fixing the protocol properly (option 2 or 3) can eliminate `useCompleteStructuralState` entirely. This would fix the remaining ObjectRef race AND reduce bandwidth. However, this is a larger refactor — the current workaround is acceptable for getting convergence working first.

### Lower-level library changes review (Registry, Tracking)

All changes are **additive** — no existing behavior modified. However:

**`ISubjectRegistry` interface (BREAKING for external implementors)**
- Added 3 new methods: `RegisterStableId`, `UnregisterStableId`, `TryGetSubjectByStableId`
- This is a breaking change for anyone who implements `ISubjectRegistry` outside the repo
- Mitigation: library is version 0.0.2 (pre-release), so breaking changes are expected
- Consider: default interface methods to make it non-breaking?

**`SubjectRegistry` detach cleanup — O(n) linear scan**
- Line 116-129: On every subject detach, iterates ALL entries in `_stableIdToSubject` to find the matching subject by reference equality. There's a TODO noting this.
- For large graphs (1000+ subjects), this linear scan on every detach could be noticeable.
- Fix: use `subject.Data.TryGetValue(SubjectIdKey)` to get the stable ID directly, then `_stableIdToSubject.Remove(id)` — O(1) instead of O(n).

**`SubjectRegistry` lock contention**
- All stable ID operations (`Register`, `Unregister`, `TryGetByStableId`) share the same `_knownSubjects` lock.
- Acceptable for now but could be a bottleneck under high concurrency.
- Already existing pattern (all SubjectRegistry methods use this lock).

**`SubjectPropertyChange.WithOldValueFrom` (Tracking)**
- `internal` method, zero-allocation for inline values.
- Does not affect existing public API or behavior.
- Clean implementation.

**`SubjectRegistryExtensions.GenerateSubjectId`**
- Uses `BigInteger` division loop — allocates ~3 objects per call.
- Called once per subject creation, so not in any hot path.
- Acceptable.

### Potential simplifications (not blocking, for later)

- [x] `SubjectItemsUpdateApplier.ApplyDictionaryUpdate`: Removed unreachable `if (propertyUpdate.Operations is { Count: > 0 })` block inside the `Operations is null` guard.
- [x] `SubjectItemsUpdateApplier`: Hoisted `GetService<ISubjectIdRegistry>()` out of all loops (4 locations).
- [x] `SubjectUpdateBuilder`: Removed dead `GetSubjectIdPairs()` method.
- [x] `SubjectUpdateBuilder.Build`: Removed unused `includeRoot` parameter.
- [x] `SubjectUpdateBuilder`: Removed stale comment "Ensure root subject gets ID '1'".

## Cleanup Tasks

- [x] **Add `TryGetSubjectId` extension method**: Added to `SubjectRegistryExtensions`. Updated applier to use it instead of magic string access.
- [x] **Eliminate `useCompleteStructuralState`**: Removed parameter and all branches. Validated with 14 PASS cycles including 10x stress test.
- [x] **Remove magic string duplication**: `TryGetSubjectId()` extension method encapsulates the internal key. Appliers no longer reference the magic string.
- [x] **Extract `ISubjectIdRegistry` interface**: Separated ID registry methods from `ISubjectRegistry` (ISP). `SubjectRegistry` implements both.
- [x] **Fix O(n) detach cleanup**: Uses `TryGetSubjectId()` for O(1) lookup instead of linear scan.
- [x] **Thread-safe `SetSubjectId`**: Added `lock(subject.Data)` around multi-step operation.
- [x] **Use `GetService` instead of `TryGetService` for `ISubjectIdRegistry`**: Registry is always required for SubjectUpdate applier.
- [ ] **Update registry.md docs**: Document the new `ISubjectIdRegistry` interface, `TryGetSubjectId`, `SetSubjectId`, `GetOrAddSubjectId` extensions, and subject ID lifecycle.
- [ ] **Update docs with updated protocol**: Update documentation in `docs/` to reflect the new stable-ID-based protocol (base62 subject IDs, ID-based collection/dictionary operations, ObjectRef replacement semantics).

## Regression Test Coverage Needed

The following bugs were found and fixed but lack dedicated unit tests to prevent regressions:

- [ ] **Fix 3 — ChangeQueueProcessor dedup old-value merging**: Test that when the same property changes A→B then B→C in the same buffer window, the deduped change preserves old=A and new=C (not old=B, new=C). File: `ChangeQueueProcessor` + `SubjectPropertyChange.WithOldValueFrom`.
- [ ] **Fix 6 — `useCompleteStructuralState` reads live property**: Test that when `useCompleteStructuralState=true`, `CreatePartialUpdateFromChanges` reads the current property value for structural types (Collection, Dictionary, ObjectRef) instead of the change snapshot. Verify this for all 3 structural kinds.
- [ ] **Fix 8b — Detached subject creates empty entry**: Test that `ProcessSubjectComplete` creates an empty Subjects entry when `TryGetRegisteredSubject()` returns null (subject detached).
- [ ] **Fix 9 — Non-root subjects always processed**: Test that when a partial update contains changes to both root and non-root subjects, ALL subjects are processed (not just the root). The if/else regression: ensure the stable-ID-lookup loop runs even when root has entries.
- [ ] **Fix 10 — ObjectRef replacement detection**: Test that when an ObjectRef property already has subject A (with stable ID "x") and the update says the property should point to subject B (with stable ID "y"), the applier creates/finds B and calls `SetValue(B)` — NOT keeping A with B's ID. Test both: same-ID (keep existing) and different-ID (replace).
- [ ] **Fix 1 — Idempotent collection Insert**: Test that applying the same Insert operation twice (same subject ID) doesn't create a duplicate in the collection.
- [ ] **Fix 2 — Collection count trim guards**: Test that a Remove operation for a non-existent ID is safely ignored (no exception, no side effects).
- [ ] **Stress test with higher structural mutation rates**: Run ConnectorTester with 10x structural mutation rates (20 structural/sec server, 10/sec clients) to increase the likelihood of concurrent structural operations overlapping. Value mutation rates are already high enough. Also try shorter buffer times (1-2ms) to stress the dedup logic with more frequent flushes during structural changes.
