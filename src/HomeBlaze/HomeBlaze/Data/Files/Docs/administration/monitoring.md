# Monitoring and Health Checks

HomeBlaze reports its health over HTTP and exports logs, metrics and traces with OpenTelemetry. The settings are listed in [Configuration](configuration.md).

See [Observability Design](../architecture/design/observability.md) for the architectural design.

## Health endpoints

| Endpoint | Checks | Use |
|----------|--------|-----|
| `/health` | All health checks | Readiness, for example a load balancer or uptime monitor |
| `/alive` | Liveness checks only | Liveness, for example a container restart policy |

Both endpoints are available in every environment, return only the status (`Healthy`, `Degraded` or `Unhealthy`) and are not traced. An unreachable Seq server does not affect them.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## OpenTelemetry

Set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to export logs, metrics and traces over OTLP to any OpenTelemetry backend or collector. The other standard OTLP exporter variables, such as `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`, apply as well.

HomeBlaze records traces only when an OTLP endpoint or Seq is configured.

## Seq

Set `ConnectionStrings:seq` (environment variable `ConnectionStrings__seq`) to the URL of a [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq) server to send logs and traces to it, for example `http://seq:5341` with the `seq` profile of the [Docker compose file](installation.md#optional-services). If Seq is not reachable, HomeBlaze keeps running and the export fails silently.

Seq and an OTLP endpoint can be used at the same time.

## Aspire dashboard

During development, the Aspire AppHost collects the logs, metrics and traces of HomeBlaze in the Aspire dashboard. See [Aspire](../development/aspire.md).
